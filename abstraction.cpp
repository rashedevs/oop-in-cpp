/*
Abstraction is the process of hiding internal implementation details while exposing only the essential
functionality to the user. Data abstraction is the process of exposing to the outside world
only the information that is necessary while concealing implementation or background information.
In C++, we use abstract classes and interfaces to achieve abstraction.
